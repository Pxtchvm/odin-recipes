    <h2>My all-time favorite sinigang</h2>

    <p>Sinigang na baboy with gabi is the ultimate Filipino comfort dish, known for its rich, savory-sour broth and tender pork pieces. What makes this version unique is the addition of gabi (taro), which thickens the soup and gives it a velvety texture. Loaded with fresh vegetables like kangkong, radish, and string beans, this dish offers a perfect balance of flavors—tangy, hearty, and satisfying.</p>

    <p>Every spoonful of sinigang is a burst of warmth and nostalgia, often evoking memories of rainy days and family meals. The combination of tender pork, creamy gabi, and the signature tamarind broth creates a flavor profile that’s both bold and comforting. Pair it with a steaming bowl of rice, and you’ve got a dish that’s sure to leave you feeling nourished and content.</p>
