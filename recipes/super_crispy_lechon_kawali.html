    <h3>Ingredients (for 2 people)</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1.2 lbs. pork belly</li>
        <li>2 pieces dried bay leaves</li>
        <li>0.6 tablespoons whole pepperoni</li>
        <li>1.2 pints water</li>
        <li>0.8 pints cooking oil</li>
        <li>0.4 tablespoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Boil water in a cooking pot.</li>
        <li>Add dried bay leaves and whole peppercorn. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add pork belly. Cover and cook in medium heat for 30 minutes or until tender. Turn the meat over (if necessary) to equally cook the opposite side.</li>
        <li>Remove the pork belly from the cooking pot. Place it in a clean plate. Let it cool down until you can safely handle it with your hands.</li>
        <li>Rub salt all over the pork. Let it stay for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep cooking pot. Once the oil gets hot (320F to 350F), put the boiled pork belly in skin side facing down. Deep fry until the skin turns brown. Note: there is no definite time for this step. Use the sound of the oil as your queue. When the oil starts to calm down a bit, check the pork belly to see if the skin is brown.</li>
        <li>Turn the pork belly over and deep fry the opposite side for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the entire pork belly slab from the cooking pot. Place it in a plate with grates or lined with paper towel. Let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Note: turn off the stove during this time.</li>
        <li>Turn on the stove to heat the oil. Once the oil is hot enough, put the pork belly back into the pot skin side facing down. Deep fry for 3 to 6 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the cooking pot. Put on a plate and let the excess oil drip.</li>
        <li>Test for crispiness by hitting the crackling (crispy skin) lightly with a fork or knife. It should create a sound. Chop the super crispy lechon kawali into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving plate. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce and a cup of warm rice.</li>
        <li>Share and enjoy!</li>
